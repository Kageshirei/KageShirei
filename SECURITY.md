## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability follow the next process:
- Open the "Security" tab
- Find the "Report a vulnerability" button
- Write the vulnerability, be as detailed as possible, show screenshots of source code (if possible) or errors. Never share archives, external links or documents of any kind except for images as they won't be taken into account.
