# RS2

RS2 is a modern, highly-customizable, command and control framework for red teams.

## Project structure

The project is structured into 4 main components:

- An `agent` that will be deployed on the target machine
- A `server` responsible for the management of agents, connections, and tasks
- A `command-and-control-gui` that will be used by red team operators to interact with the server
- A series of `libs` that will be shared between the different components

## Features & status

The project is still in its early stages, we have many features planned, we'll proceed to implement them as we go.
