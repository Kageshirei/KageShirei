/// Type definition for the RtlCreateHeap function.
///
/// Creates a heap with the specified attributes. The heap can be used to allocate and manage memory dynamically.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `[in]` - `Flags`: Specifies the attributes of the heap. This can include options such as enabling heap serialization.
/// - `[in, opt]` - `HeapBase`: A pointer to a memory block that will serve as the base of the heap. This parameter can be `NULL`, in which case the system determines the base address.
/// - `[in]` - `ReserveSize`: The initial size, in bytes, to reserve for the heap. This is the amount of virtual memory reserved for the heap.
/// - `[in]` - `CommitSize`: The initial size, in bytes, of committed memory in the heap. This is the amount of physical memory initially allocated for the heap.
/// - `[in, opt]` - `Lock`: A pointer to a lock for heap synchronization. This can be `NULL` if no lock is required.
/// - `[in, opt]` - `Parameters`: A pointer to an optional structure that specifies advanced parameters for heap creation. This can be `NULL`.
///
/// # Returns
/// - `HANDLE`: A handle to the newly created heap. If the heap creation fails, the handle will be `NULL`.

///
/// # Parameters
/// - `[in]` - `hHeap`: A handle to the heap from which the memory will be allocated.
/// - `[in]` - `dwFlags`: Flags that control aspects of the allocation, such as whether to generate exceptions on failure.
/// - `[in]` - `dwBytes`: The number of bytes to allocate from the heap.

/// # Parameters
/// - `[in]` - `hHeap`: A handle to the heap from which the memory was allocated.
/// - `[in]` - `dwFlags`: Flags that control aspects of the free operation, such as whether to perform validation checks.
/// - `[in]` - `lpMem`: A pointer to the memory block to be freed.

/// # Returns
/// - `BOOL`: A boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful (`TRUE`) or not (`FALSE`).

/// - `[in]` - `hHeap`: A handle to the heap from which the memory will be reallocated.
/// - `[in]` - `dwFlags`: Flags that control aspects of the reallocation, such as whether to generate exceptions on failure.
/// - `[in]` - `lpMem`: A pointer to the memory block to be reallocated.

/// # Returns
